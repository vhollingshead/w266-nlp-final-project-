With OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's recent call for regulation and democratic processes for generative AI systems before the U.S. Senate, there remains the question of how generative AI tools can be developed to support low-resource language speakers in non-Western cultural contexts. One of the key challenges is addressing the LLM performance gap between high and low-resource languages, due largely to the asymmetric availability of digitized corpora. The low-resource language for this research will be Tagalog, the primary language spoken by the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) migrant population, who have had a longstanding history of maltreatment cases in the Middle East and East Asia since the 1970s. Through this project, researchers hope to discover if augmentation techniques can be used to improve machine translation performance, and with this information, outline the steps necessary to address the performance gap between Tagalog and other standard high-resource languages.
